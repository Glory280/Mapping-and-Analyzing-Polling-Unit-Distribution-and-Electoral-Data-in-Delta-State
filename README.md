# Mapping and Analyzing Polling Unit Distribution and Electoral Data in Delta State

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze and enhance the operational efficiency of polling units in Delta State. Using geographical data and advanced data analysis techniques, I identified neighboring polling units, assessed the accuracy and integrity of result sheets, and provided actionable insights for improving the electoral process. This comprehensive analysis will support better decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning for future elections.

## Problem Statement
The electoral process in Delta State faces challenges related to the management and integrity of polling unit results. Key issues include the detection of invalid, unclear, or unsigned result sheets and the need to understand the geographical proximity of polling units to optimize resource deployment. Without accurate data and analysis, these challenges hinder the ability to ensure fair and efficient elections. This project addresses these issues by analyzing polling unit data to identify neighboring units within a defined radius, and by evaluating the integrity of result sheets, thereby contributing to improved electoral processes.
