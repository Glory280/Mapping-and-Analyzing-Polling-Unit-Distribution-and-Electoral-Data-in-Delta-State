# Mapping and Analyzing Polling Unit Distribution and Electoral Data in Delta State

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze and enhance the operational efficiency of polling units in Delta State. Using geographical data and advanced data analysis techniques, I identified neighboring polling units, assessed the accuracy and integrity of result sheets, and provided actionable insights for improving the electoral process. This comprehensive analysis will support better decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning for future elections.

## Problem Statement
The electoral process in Delta State faces challenges related to the management and integrity of polling unit results. Key issues include the detection of invalid, unclear, or unsigned result sheets and the need to understand the geographical proximity of polling units to optimize resource deployment. Without accurate data and analysis, these challenges hinder the ability to ensure fair and efficient elections. This project addresses these issues by analyzing polling unit data to identify neighboring units within a defined radius, and by evaluating the integrity of result sheets, thereby contributing to improved electoral processes.

## Skills Applied
To provide analysis of polling units in Delta State, I applied the following skills;
- Data Cleaning and Validation
- Data Analysis
- Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
- Custom Scripting and Automation
- Communication and Reporting

## Insights
The following insights were gotten from studying the outliers in the dataset
- There are notable outliers in the result section for parties PDP, APC and LP
- In polling units where there are no accredited voters, there are recorded votes which is abnormal
- Towns with more population had higher number of votes than villages with lesser populations

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The presence of recorded votes in polling units with no accredited voters indicates significant data integrity issues. Immediate investigation and procedural improvements are necessary to ensure the accuracy of future elections. Significant outliers in the election results for PDP, APC, and LP suggest potential data issues or irregularities. A detailed review and verification process should be undertaken to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the results. The trend of higher votes in towns compared to villages reflects expected population dynamics. However, it is essential to review and potentially adjust resource allocation to ensure fairness in voting practices across different regions.
