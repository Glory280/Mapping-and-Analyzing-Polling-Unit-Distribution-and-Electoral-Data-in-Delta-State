## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze and enhance the operational efficiency of polling units in Delta State. Using geographical data and advanced data analysis techniques, I identified neighboring polling units, assessed the accuracy and integrity of result sheets, and provided actionable insights for improving the electoral process. This comprehensive analysis will support better decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning for future elections.

## Problem Statement
The electoral process in Delta State faces challenges related to the management and integrity of polling unit results. Some of the key issues are the detection of invalid, unclear, or unsigned result sheets. Without accurate data and analysis, these challenges hinder the ability to ensure fair and efficient elections. 
This project addresses these issues by analyzing polling unit data to identify outliers and anomalies and evaluating unusual patterns. 
This report also provide recommendations to address these anomalies, improve data handling, and enhance voter engagement.

## Skills Applied
To provide analysis of polling units in Delta State, I applied the following skills;
- Data Cleaning and Validation
- Data Analysis
- Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
- Custom Scripting and Automation
- Communication and Reporting

## Insights
The following insights were obtained from studying the outliers in the dataset
- There are 151 polling units where there are no accredited voters but there are recorded votes which is abnormal
- 540 polling units with a high number of corrected result sheets were identified
- There are 139 polling units with no results recorded but has recorded number of accredited voters
- Towns with more population had a higher number of votes than villages with lesser populations

## Recommendations
- Investigate the 151 polling units where results were gotten with no accredited voters recorded to understand why there are results without any accredited voters. This could indicate data entry errors or electoral malpractice. Proper verification processes should be put in place for future elections to avoid reoccurrence.
- Review the process of result sheet correction in these 540 polling units to identify common issues leading to corrections. Implement training programs for election officers to reduce errors and the need for corrections in future elections.
- Investigate the 139 polling units where no results were recorded despite having accredited voters. Determine if there were issues with result transmission, data entry errors, or other anomalies that need addressing.
- The trend of higher votes in towns compared to villages reflects expected population dynamics. However, it is essential to review and adjust resource allocation to ensure fairness in voting practices across different regions.

## Conclusion
Based on the insights obtained from the analysis, it is recommended to investigate the 151 polling units with results but no accredited voters to identify potential data entry errors or electoral malpracice. Review the 540 polling units with corrected result sheets to minimize errors through training, and examine the 139 units with accredited voters but no results for transmission issues or anomalies. Review and adjust resource allocation to ensure fairness in voting practices across different regions.
